Fares Arnous
I join hack your future course because I want to improve my knowledge in programing, I have some experience using PHP language and I want to combine it with JavaScript so I can make great work.

and I have learned the code by myself but I feel that I am still weak with it, that is why I want to continue with hack your future to be more mastery writing a code.

and absolutely this course will help me find a good job here in Canada.
